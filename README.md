# Digital Bank System

This project is being developed as the Integrative Project of my university (UNIVESP).

The goal of this project is to build a web system similar to a Digital Banking platform, applying concepts of software development, databases, and version control.

Throughout the development of the project, this repository and this README file will be updated to reflect new features, improvements, and architectural decisions.
